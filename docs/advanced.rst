Engines
-------

By default Needle uses the PIL engine (``needle.engines.pil_engine.Engine``) to take screenshots. Instead of PIL, you may also use PerceptualDiff or ImageMagick.


Example with PerceptualDiff:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --driver Chrome --needle-engine perceptualdiff test_example.py

Example with ImageMagick:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --driver Chrome --needle-engine imagemagick test_example.py

Besides being much faster than PIL, PerceptualDiff and ImageMagick also generate a diff PNG file when a test fails, highlighting the differences between the baseline image and the new screenshot.

Note that to use the PerceptualDiff engine you will first need to `download <http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/>`_ the perceptualdiff binary and place it in your PATH.

To use the ImageMagick engine you will need to install a package on your machine (e.g. sudo apt-get install imagemagick on Ubuntu or brew install imagemagick on OSX).


------------
File cleanup
------------

Each time you run tests, Needle will create new screenshot images on disk, for comparison with the baseline screenshots.
Itâ€™s then up to you whether you want to delete them or archive them. To remove screenshots from successful test use:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --driver Chrome --needle-cleanup-on-success test_example.py

Any unsuccessful tests will remain on the file system.


-----------
File output
-----------

To specify a path for baseline image path use:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --driver Chrome --needle-baseline-dir /path/to/baseline/images

Default path is ./screenshots/baseline

To specify a path for output image path use:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --driver Chrome --needle-output-dir /path/to/output/images

Default path is ./screenshots

Generating HTML reports
-----------------------

To generate html reports use:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --driver Chrome --html=report.html --self-contained-html
