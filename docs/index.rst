pytest-needle is a pytest implementation of `needle <https://github.com/python-needle/needle>`_.

It's fairly similar to needle and shares much of the same functionality,
except it uses `pytest-selenium <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium>`_ for handling the webdriver
and implements needle as a fixture instead of having test cases inherit from needle's base test class.
