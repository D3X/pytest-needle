pytest-needle
=============

pytest-needle is a pytest implementation of [needle](https://github.com/python-needle/needle).

It's fairly similar to needle and shares much of the same functionality, 
except it uses [pytest-selenium](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium) for handling the webdriver 
and implements needle as a fixture instead of having test cases inherit from needle's base test class.


Installation
------------

Install through pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-needle
```


Install from source:

```bash

cd /path/to/source/pytest-needle
python setup.py install 
```

Example
-------

Example needle pytest implementation:

```python
"""test_example.py
"""

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import pytest

@pytest.mark.element
def test_example_element(needle):
    """Example for comparing individual elements

    :param NeedleDriver needle: NeedleDriver instance
    :return:
    """

    # Navigate to web page
    needle.driver.get('https://www.google.com')

    # Take an element screen diff
    needle.assert_screenshot('search_field', (By.ID, 'tsf'))

```

To create a baseline for all subsequent test run:

```bash
pytest --driver Chrome --needle-save-baseline test_example.py
```

After we have a baseline, to run test use:

```bash
pytest --driver Chrome test_example.py
```

Selecting a WebDriver
---------------------

To control which browser to use, use `--driver <BROWSER>` from pytest-selenium. For example to change to browser to Firefox:

```bash
pytest --driver Firefox test_example.py
```

Setting the viewport's size
---------------------------

You may set the size of the browser's viewport using the `set_viewport_size()` on the needle fixture

```python

def test_example_viewport(needle):

    # Navigate to web page
    needle.set_viewport_size(width=1024, height=768)
    
    # Rest of the test ...
    
```

You may also set the default viewport size for all your tests by using the command line argument `--needle-viewport-size`:

```bash
pytest --driver Chrome --needle-viewport-size "1024 x 768" test_example.py
```

Engines
-------

By default Needle uses the PIL engine (`needle.engines.pil_engine.Engine`) to take screenshots. Instead of PIL, you may also use PerceptualDiff or ImageMagick.


Example with PerceptualDiff:

```bash
pytest --driver Chrome --needle-engine perceptualdiff test_example.py
```
 
Example with ImageMagick:
 
```bash
pytest --driver Chrome --needle-engine imagemagick test_example.py
```
 
Besides being much faster than PIL, PerceptualDiff and ImageMagick also generate a diff PNG file when a test fails, highlighting the differences between the baseline image and the new screenshot.

Note that to use the PerceptualDiff engine you will first need to [download](http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/) the perceptualdiff binary and place it in your PATH.

To use the ImageMagick engine you will need to install a package on your machine (e.g. sudo apt-get install imagemagick on Ubuntu or brew install imagemagick on OSX).


File cleanup
------------

Each time you run tests, Needle will create new screenshot images on disk, for comparison with the baseline screenshots. 
Itâ€™s then up to you whether you want to delete them or archive them. To remove screenshots from successful test use:

```bash
pytest --driver Chrome --needle-cleanup-on-success test_example.py
```

Any unsuccessful tests will remain on the file system.


File output
-----------

To specify a path for baseline image path use:

```bash
pytest --driver Chrome --needle-baseline-dir /path/to/baseline/images
```

Default path is ./screenshots/baseline

To specify a path for output image path use:

```bash
pytest --driver Chrome --needle-output-dir /path/to/output/images
```

Default path is ./screenshots


Planed Features
---------------

- pytest-html integration, embed images into reports
- Element masking (Exclude areas that frequently change)
